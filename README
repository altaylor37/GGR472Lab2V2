This website contains information regarding the Top 10 busiest airports in Canada.

The map portion has a sidebar with a list of the airports. When the name is clicked, the map zooms into the point location on the map.
There is also a button to zoom back out to Canada. 
When clicking on an airport point, a popup window appears providing more detailed information about the ranking, passenger numbers, and province of the airport.

The Navbar is a feature that I wanted to play with and while not directly related to the assignment, it was helpful to understand. 
The dropdown menu shows the three air-rail downtown links in Canada. The sub-pages are static but show some pictures and provide information about the services.

2. Filter map to add / subtract layers (population density / legend / airports / air rail links).
3. There is now a legend.
4. The main cloropleth map layer is of Canada created in ArcGIS Pro. It was a matter of inputing the popualtion data and dividing it by the land area per province.
